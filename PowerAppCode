1.	List_grievances: 
a.	New Grievance button: This button will navigate to a frm_NewGrievance Record to capture new grievance from the employee. The code written behind that is:
Navigate(
frm_NewGrievance,
ScreenTransition.Fade
);
LookUp(Departments,new_departmentid=ThisItem.Department, new_name)
LookUp(GrievanceLibrary, Title = TitleGrievance.Text, Image)

Where GrievanceLibrary is the Sharepoint Datasource added in Powerapp and Title and image are the fields created in SharePoint.

To open the Grievance record on frm_Grievance Record, write the below code:
Navigate(frm_GrievanceRecord,ScreenTransition.Fade,glryGrievances.Selected)

2.	frm_NewGrievanceRecord: 
To store the new grievance record, we used the Form Screen.


On the update button, write the below code:
Patch(
    Grievances,
    Defaults(Grievances),
    {
        new_employeefullname: DataCardValue3.Text,
        new_description: DataCardValue15.Text,
        _new_departmentl_value: DataCardValue10.Selected.new_departmentid,
        _new_grievancetypel_value: DataCardValue6.Selected.new_grievancetypeid,
        new_signature: PenInput4.Image
    }
);
Patch(
    GrievanceLibrary,
    Defaults(GrievanceLibrary),
    {
        Title: DataCardValue3.Text,
        Image: First(Collection1).Url
    }
);
UpdateContext({resettext: !resettext});
UpdateContext({resetcombobox: !resetcombobox});
Navigate(SuccessScrn,ScreenTransition.Fade);
3.	frm_CameraScreen
Insert a Camera Media Control on the form as shown in the below screen shot.

Insert an image control on the form below the Camera Media control.
Capture button code:
ClearCollect(Collection1, Camera1.Photo)

Collection 1 s described above is the SharePoint collection object which needs to be cleared and then referred with the new Photo from the Camera Control, which in our case is Camera1.

Confirm button code:
Confirm Button will only Navigate it to New Grievance form and the code is ass per below:
Navigate(frm_NewGrievance)

To summarise: 
1.	We learned how to create a Canvas Power app.
2.	Different controls that can be used.
3.	How to store image on Sharepoint in a Power app.
a.	Again I am sharing the code for storing the image on Sharepoint herewith:
Patch(
    GrievanceLibrary,
    Defaults(GrievanceLibrary),
    {
        Title: DataCardValue3.Text,
        Image: First(Collection1).Url
    }
);
b.	To explain the above code, GrievanceLibrary is the SharePoint site of which Data Source is added.
c.	Title: This is a field in the Sharepoint library that will store the name of the Grievance. The data type in Sharepoint for Title is Single line Text
d.	Image: This will store the image in Sharepoint library in Base64 format. The data type of this field will be Multi lines of Text , but, we need to ensure that the rich text format is set to No. Please refer to the below screen shot.
